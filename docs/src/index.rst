      Training session announcement

PyMoDAQ, Modular Data Acquisition with Python, is a set of **python** modules used to interface any kind of experiments.
It simplifies the interaction with detector and actuator hardware to go straight to the data acquisition of interest.

It has two purposes:

* First, to provide a complete interface to perform automated measurements or logging data without having to write
  a user/interface for each new experiment.
* Second, to provide various tools (User interfaces, classes dedicated to specific tasks...) to easily build a :ref:`custom_app`

It is divided in two main components as shown on figure :numref:`overview_submodules`

* The :ref:`Dashboard_module` and its control modules: :ref:`DAQ_Move_module` and  :ref:`DAQ_Viewer_module`
* Extensions such as the :ref:`DAQ_Scan_module` or the :ref:`DAQ_Logger_module`

   PyMoDAQ's Dashboard and its extensions: DAQ_Scan for automated acquisitions, DAQ_Logger for data logging and many other.


The Control modules are interfacing real instruments using user written plugins. The complete list of available plugins
is maintained on this GitHub `repository`__ and installabled using the :ref:`PluginManager`
